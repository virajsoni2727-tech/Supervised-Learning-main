## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Message Classification Project** is a Machine Learning-based web application that automatically classifies digital messages as **Spam** or **Legitimate**.

This project applies concepts of **Probability Theory**, **Distance-Based Learning**, **Margin-Based Learning**, and **Probabilistic Classification** to compare different machine learning algorithms for spam detection.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a classification system that identifies whether incoming messages are:

* **0 → Legitimate Message**
* **1 → Spam Message**

---

## 🌐 Live Demo

**Streamlit Application:**
https://message-intelligence-system-pr-4.streamlit.app/

---

## 📂 Dataset Features

The dataset contains message-related features:

* Message Length
* Number of Special Characters
* Number of URLs
* Keyword Frequency Score
* Sender Activity Score
* Time-Based Features
* Target Variable: `Spam_Label`

### Target Labels

| Label | Meaning            |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 0     | Legitimate Message |
| 1     | Spam Message       |
