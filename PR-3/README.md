# 🏠 Residential Property Valuation Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

The House Price Prediction project is a machine learning application developed to estimate residential property prices based on various housing features. The project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning model building, and performance evaluation to identify the most effective predictive model.

This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC), from data collection to model evaluation and interpretation.

# 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

## 1. House Price Distribution

Image:
`images/price_distribution.png`

Observation:
- Most houses belong to the medium-price category.
- High-priced houses create a right-skewed distribution.

## 2. Correlation Heatmap

Image:
`images/correlation_heatmap.png`

Observation:
- Area has a strong positive correlation with house price.
- Bathrooms and stories also influence prices significantly.

# ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Missing value handling
- Duplicate record checking
- Label Encoding
- Feature Scaling
- Train-Test Split (80:20)

Example:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42
)
```

# 📏 Evaluation Metrics

## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

MAE = (1/n) × Σ|Actual − Predicted|

Measures average prediction error.

---

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)

MSE = (1/n) × Σ(Actual − Predicted)²

Penalizes large errors.

---

## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RMSE = √MSE

Provides error in original units.

---

## R² Score

R² = 1 − (SSE/SST)

Measures variance explained by the model.

---

# 📈 Model Performance

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Linear Regression | XX | XX | XX |
| Ridge Regression | XX | XX | XX |
| Lasso Regression | XX | XX | XX |
| Decision Tree | XX | XX | XX |
| Random Forest | XX | XX | XX |

Replace XX with your actual values.
